  <p id="demo" style="text-align: center; margin-right: 5%;"><b>Black Lives Matter</b> Enlightenment is a centralized website on which users can take action to foster community intervention in response to non-violent protests, which are in alignment with the official Black Lives Matter campaign’s pillars. <br>  <br> <b>Black lives matter</b> is an online campaign that started in 2013 as a result of the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's alleged murderer who was a police officer claiming he shot Martin due to self defense, according to blacklivesmatter.com. Because this campaign started online with the #blacklivesmatter, it remains as a decentralized network with no formal hierarchy. Extant apps provide content that are not all credible, contain inspiring quotes, wallpapers which are more of passive actions that may not stimulate community intervention. We recognized that there is not a hub on the market (in the Apple and Google stores) that incite or motivate people who care about the campaign to take action; hence, the creation of this website is to allow those who has not had the chance to participate in BLM to express and those who have had their voices heard to further propagate their core messages.</p>
