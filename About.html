<h1 style="margin-left: 2%;text-align: center;">Who We Are</h1>
<p>Black Lives Matter Enlightenment is a centralized website on which users can take action to foster community intervention in response to non-violent protests, which are in alignment with the official Black Lives Matter campaign’s pillars-- Diversity, Globalism, Empathy, Restorative justice and Intergenerationality. <span id="dots"></span><span id="more"><br><br>Black Lives Matter is an online campaign that started in 2013 as a result of the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's alleged murderer who was a police officer claiming he shot Martin due to self defense. Because this campaign started online with the #blacklivesmatter, it remains as a decentralized network with no formal hierarchy. Extant apps provide content that are not all credible, contain inspiring quotes, wallpapers which are more of passive actions that may not stimulate community intervention. We recognized that there is not a hub on the market (in the Apple and Google stores) that incite or motivate people who care about the campaign to take action; hence, the creation of this website is to allow those who has not had the chance to participate in BLM to express and those who have had their voices heard to further propagate their core messages.</span></p>

<h1 style="margin-left: 2%;text-align: center;">Mission Statement</h1>
<p>Due to the resurgence of recent uprisings and learning that most BLM-related apps were launched back in 2013-2015 with few updates, this web application serves to fill in the market gap so that web users who are ages 16 or up have direct access to state Attorney Generals’ official web pages, email and petition templates for outreach to local authorities, and pertinent helplines. <span id="dots"></span><span id="more1"><br><br>In the future, this web app will not only incite action but also serve to promote awareness. The secondary intent is to provide access to various content to promote awareness of the black community (i.e. current events articles, Black history, motivational speakers, pop culture content).</span></p>

<h1 style="margin-left: 2%;text-align: center;">Our Goal</h1>
<p>The goal is to minimize the disproportionate assistance and inadequate outreach from the black community and those who care about this cause via the use of our web app.
